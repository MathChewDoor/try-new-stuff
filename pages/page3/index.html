                    As a novice in programming, I am currently building a foundational understanding of languages such as C++, HTML, and CSS. Through coursework and personal exploration, I am learning to develop basic web pages and explore the fundamentals of software development.

                    Beyond my academic pursuits, I am eager to expand my knowledge through hands-on projects and collaborative learning opportunities. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges and am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my journey as a programmer.
